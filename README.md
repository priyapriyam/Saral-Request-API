# Saral-Request-API

SARAL is the eLearning platform of NavGurukul. Which is available on website saral.navgurukul.org created a CLI based app where users can access the content of saral using the terminal. So basically I used Requist ( library in Python used for making a http requests )

In python3 through requests library, fetching data from saral/navgurukul website
